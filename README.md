Red-Blue Nim is a two-player strategy game in which players take turns removing marbles from red and blue piles. These are the settings: Standard-the player who takes the last marble wins; Misere-the player who takes the last marble loses. Moves are determined through the MinMax algorithm to optimize moves and adjust difficulty.
